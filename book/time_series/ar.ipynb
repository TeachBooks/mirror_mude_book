    "The main goal is to introduce the AutoRegressive (AR) model to describe a **stationary stochastic process**. Hence the AR model can be applied on time series where e.g. trend and seasonality are not present / removed, and only noise remains, or after applying other methods [to obtain a stationary time series](stationarize).\n",

    "In an AR model, we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of its past values. A zero mean AR process of orders $p$ can be written as follows:\n",
