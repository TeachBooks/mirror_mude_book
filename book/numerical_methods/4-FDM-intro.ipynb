    "# Related equations that you will encounter\n",
    "\n",
    "During your master's program, you will encounter some of the following equations, often solved with the FDM (with examples):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heat conduction equation for materials: crucial for designing temperature control systems in buildings, predicting concrete curing, and analyzing the behavior of geothermal systems.\n",
    "- Stress-strain equation for structural loading: essential for designing safe buildings, bridges, etc., to withstand long-term environmental and operational loads.\n",
    "- Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow: for designing water supply systems, drainage networks, and simulating groundwater flow in geotechnical engineering.\n",
    "- Advection-diffusion equation for pollutant dispersion: omnipresent in the analysis of civil contamination spread, design effective wastewater treatment systems, and assessment of environmental impact.\n",
    "- Wave equation: for modeling seismic waves and their effect on structures.\n",
    "- Finite Element Method (FEM): not an equation but a numerical technique closely related to the FDM. It is used for solving complex structural and thermal problems by dividing them into smaller, manageable elements and solving equations for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevance to your master's program/track/discipline (not a complete list but you can find plenty of examples online)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared this list to emphasize the relevance of the FDM to your program at TU Delft. You may or may not encounter some (or all) of these as this list is not exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applied earth sciences: groundwater flow modeling, geothermal modeling, and seismic wave propagation.\n",
    "- Structural engineering: stress-strain estimation in structures, heat conduction, and vibration analysis.\n",
    "- Hydraulic engineering: simulating coastal and river hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and erosion.\n",
    "- Transport engineering: simulating traffic flow, congestion patterns, optimizing traffic signals, public transport planning, and pedestrian/bicycle flow.\n",
    "- Environmental engineering: dispersion of air pollutants in air and water, groundwater flow modeling, gas generation in landfills, environmental contamination, forecasting weather and extreme events, and studying climate change and its impact.\n",
    "- Offshore engineering: wave and wind loading and often combined with the finite volume method (FVM) for more detailed fluid analysis, FEM for detailed structural analysis, and many times, a combination of FVM and FEM for fluid-structure interaction (FSI).\n",
    "- Sanitary engineering and urban water infrastructure: designing wastewater treatment plants, sewer system layout, water quality analysis, and demand forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the FDM is omnipresent and essential for all tracks in civil engineering. Some of you may not have to use it directly for whatever you pursue later, but you may encounter a computer code that is based on the FDM. In such a situation, a fundamental understanding of the FDM, especially the underlying mathematics, is essential for not using the code like a 'black box'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we intend to impart in week 1.6.\n"

    "## Objective and suggestions for Week 1.6 FDE\n",
    "\n",
    "- The objective is to familiarize oneself with the discretization of differential equations, estimating relevant derivatives using the Taylor series and setting up a numerical solver.\n",
    "- The week involves mathematics, so while you navigate through the content, please remember that mathematics begins with a pen and paper.\n",
    "- The textbook provides simple details on the lecture’s content. Please use the recordings as the main source of information.\n",
    "- There is ample learning material available online (and in the library). We suggest using videos instead of books as they are more effective.\n"
