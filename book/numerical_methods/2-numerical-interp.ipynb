    "As we saw on the previous page, to produce numerical solutions, we need to find a way to solve a variety of equations using a computer. Unlike the previous page, often we are interested in functions, and integrals of functions, that are not easy to compute. However, a common approach is to use an approximate solution to represent the true function. We are also interested in showing what the accuracy of the approximate function is, to confirm whether or not it is accurate enough for our purpose at hand. As such, this page introduces two fundamental concepts: approximating a function with polynomials and approximating the integrals of specfic functions.\n",
