    "**Important things to retain from this block:**\n",
    "- Recognize the difference between single and multi-stage algorithms, single-step and multi-step algorithms (both implicit and explicit).\n",
    "- Understand that higher order (and implicit) methods are often more stable (you can use a wider range of timesteps) than lower order methods.\n",
    "- Always remember that stability is no guarantee of accuracy and convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward and forward Euler methods are the simplest methods for numerically solving differential equations. Let’s start with a simple equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "y'(t) &= f(y,t) \\\\\n",
    "y(t_0) &= y_0\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can reformulate the above using Forward Euler (FE) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t f(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) = F_{FE}(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "FE is a single-stage explicit algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mid-Point Quadrature\n",
    "\n",
    "FE can be improved further by estimating the function $f$ at the midpoint between $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$ using what is known as the midpoint quadrature. One simply replaces the location where $f$ is used for the FE equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t f\\left(y_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}f(y_n,t_n), t_n+\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) = F_{RK2}(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, RK2 refers to the second-order Runge Kutta method, which is a single-step explicit method. FE and RK2 are exactly the same in construction but RK2 has a truncation error of the 3rd order, making it a 2nd order accurate method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More Stages, More Computational Time but More Accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4th order explicit Runge-Kutta (RK4) method has four stages, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6}(k_1+2k_2+2k_3+k_4) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^5) = F_{RK4}(y_n,t_n) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^5)$$\n",

    "The figures above depict the steps involved in the FE and the RK4. As both methods are explicit, they will have to satisfy a stability criterion pertinent to the equation being solved. However, the RK4 used more points (stages) and hence, it is stabler for larger time-steps than the FE.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one requires both stability and accuracy at large time-steps, one must use an implicit formulation such as the implicit mid-point RK2 (Gauss-Legendre) or the Crank-Nicolson method. Can you think of what the equation for implicit RK2 looks like?\n",

    "## Multi-step or Multi-stage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-stage methods try to approximate the slope in multiple stages (RK4) but are dependent only on one point $y_{n}$. A multi-step method uses multiple points for approximations i.e. $y_{n}, y_{n-1}$ and so on. One well-known example is the two-step Adams-Bashforth method that predicts the future values of $y$ at discrete time steps based on its previous values and the function $f(t, y)$. The formula for the 2-step Adams-Bashforth method is:\n",
