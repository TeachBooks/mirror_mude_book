    "## Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical stability deals with the impact of approximation errors introduced in simplifying a differential equation (in our case). A numerical method (or a solver) is stable if it does not magnify these truncation errors unboundedly as the computation proceeds. Mathematically, numerical stability can be defined with the following example.\n",

    "that is being solved using finite time steps. The solution at the time-step $n + 1$ is approximated as $y_{n+1}$ as a function of the solution $y_n$ that was obtained at the time-step $n$. Recall that $h$ is the step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = G(t_n, y_n, h)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximation is numerically stable if, for any initial condition $y_0$ and any time step size $h$, the error between the numerical solution and the true solution remains bounded as $n$ (the number of time steps) increases. In formal terms, there exists a real number $C$, independent of $n$, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|y_n - y(t_n)| \\leq C$$\n",

    "Let’s consider a simple example. For $y(0) = 1$, the equation\n",

    "$$y' = -\\alpha y \\quad (\\text{where } \\alpha > 0)$$\n",

    "$$y(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}$$\n",

    "Using Forward Euler one obtains:\n",

    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n - \\alpha hy_n = (1-\\alpha h)y_n = (1-\\alpha h)^2y_{n-1} = \\ldots = (1-\\alpha h)^{n+1}y_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation, any $y_n$ is approximated as a function of $y_{n-1}$ by repeated application of the forward Euler scheme. You’ll notice that the relationship between $y_{n+1}$ and $y_0$ is an exponential function of $1-\\alpha h$. To prevent a ‘growth’ in the magnitude of the error, $1-\\alpha h$ should be less than 1, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",

    "In short, the explicit Forward Euler scheme is conditionally stable. The above condition must be satisfied (hence, it is a necessary condition) for numerical stability. What implication does this have for numerical solvers in general? It places an upper limit on the time-step that one can use.\n",

    "This also leads to the question: Are there schemes that are not accompanied by a stability criterion? Let’s repeat the above analysis with the Backward Euler scheme (implicit). One obtains\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n - \\alpha hy_{n+1} \\implies y_{n+1}(1+\\alpha h) = y_n$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, the only condition that must be satisfied for stability is\n",
