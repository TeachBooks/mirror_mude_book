# Note about FEM Materials

Nov, 2024: Robert copy/pasted entire contents from computational modelling (commit hash [72b865ba](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/interactivetextbooks-citg/computational-modelling/-/commit/72b865baafb124801b2661dfc33ab01eb7aa269f))
- repo is https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/interactivetextbooks-citg/computational-modelling/
- comp modelling subdirectory on `main` branch: `\computational-modelling-main\book\introduction\.`
- book subdirectory: `\book\book\fem\.`

yes there are extra files, but it's easier to remember to just paste everything

## Additional modifications to the pages are made

Pages:
`isoparametric_mapping.md`
