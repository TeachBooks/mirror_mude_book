    "\n",
    "For example, consider `[1, 2.5, 'asdf', False, [1.5, True]]` - this is a Python list but it has different types for every element. When you do math on this, every element has to be handled separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists may serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. Numpy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. Numpy is the most used library for scientific computing. Even if you are not using it directly, chances are high that some library uses it in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "The array data structure in numpy is called `ndarray`, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with `ndarray` very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a ‘grid’ of values, with all the same types. It is indexed by tuples of non negative indices and provides the framework for multiple dimensions. An array has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dtype` - data type. Arrays always contain one type\n",
    "- `shape` - shape of the data, for example 3×2 or 3×2×500 or even 500 (one dimensional) or [] (zero dimensional).\n",
    "- `data` - raw data storage in memory. This can be passed to C or Fortran code for efficient calculations."
