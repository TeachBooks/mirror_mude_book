    "# Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution based on observed data $\\mathbf{x} = x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. Evaluating the joint density of the data given a parametric family $\\theta$ gives the likelihood function, which is a function that measures how well the observed data fits the probability distribution with the given parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x} \\mid \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i \\mid \\theta)\n",

    "The goal of MLE is to find the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. The maximum likelihood estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the set of parameters for which the observed data is the most probable with the assumed probability distribution:\n",
