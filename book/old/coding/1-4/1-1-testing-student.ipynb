    "## Why are we doing testing\n",
    "Testing our code is necessary, because we as humans all make mistakes. Some of our mistakes may not be that important, but some can be dangeours and harmful. There are numerous examples of the latter such as the explosion of the Ariane 5 rocket or the problem with NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter. You can read more on these examples [here](https://medium.com/swlh/some-of-the-most-famous-bugs-in-software-history-bb16a2ee3f8e). Testing our code for hidden flaws is the first step towards ensuring that the programs we write are robust.\n",

    "You may be wondering why should we handle multiple exceptions. Depending on the exception raised, we can set up different behaviour for our application. For example, if a `ZeroDivisionError`, the issue is most likely in the user providing arguments, so we could inform them about it specifically. However, if a `ValueError` is thrown, it may be related to our logic. In that case we should be able to investigate the cause of it. Handling different types of exceptions will be useful in the coming section: [Logging](#Logging)."

For example, it is possible to use timestamps with the messages you create and it is also possible to group messages by type. Furthermore, logging can let the user specify a file, where the logging information can be stored. This can be useful in case of an application crash to identify the cause of it by examining the logs.<br><br>\n",
